# zeldoc

Command-line client for [Zeldoc.ai](https://zeldoc.ai), the EU-sovereign LLM API.

It is small on purpose. It exposes the parts of Zeldoc.ai that are useful from a shell,
and coding agents such as Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode or Pi can use it with no plugin:
any agent that can run a command can list models, check its usage or search the web
through Zeldoc.ai.

## Install

**macOS and Linux:**

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/martinmose/zeldoc-cli/releases/latest/download/zeldoc-installer.sh | sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c "irm https://github.com/martinmose/zeldoc-cli/releases/latest/download/zeldoc-installer.ps1 | iex"
```

The installers download the prebuilt binary for your platform from the
[latest release](https://github.com/martinmose/zeldoc-cli/releases/latest), check its
checksum and put it in `~/.local/bin` (`%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin` on Windows), or in
`$XDG_BIN_HOME` when that is set, adding the directory to your `PATH` if needed. Open a
new terminal afterwards. No Rust toolchain is needed.

Releases have binaries for macOS (Apple silicon and Intel), Linux (x86_64 and ARM64) and
Windows (x86_64); you can also download an archive from the release page yourself. To
build from source instead: `cargo install --path .`

## Update

```bash
zeldoc update            # install the latest release in place of this one
zeldoc update --check    # only say whether a newer release exists
```

`zeldoc update` downloads the latest release's installer and runs it, so the new version
replaces the old one in the same folder. It works for copies installed with the commands
above. A copy built with `cargo install` or unpacked from an archive by hand is updated
the way it was installed.

Once a day, a command run in a terminal also checks GitHub for a newer release, in the
background, and prints a line to stderr when there is one. Commands whose output goes to a
pipe or a file, as in scripts and coding agents, never check. Set `ZELDOC_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`
to turn the check off.

## Authenticate

Save an API key once. It is checked against Zeldoc.ai before it is stored:

```bash
zeldoc auth login
```

The key is saved as the profile `default`; see [One key per customer](#one-key-per-customer)
for more than one key. The key is read from a hidden prompt, or from standard input when input is piped
(`zeldoc auth login < key.txt`). Don't have a key yet? See
[Generate an API key](https://docs.zeldoc.ai/connect-opencode#generate-an-api-key).

`ZELDOC_API_KEY`, when set, takes precedence over the default saved key, so existing
setups keep working without a login.

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `zeldoc auth login` | Checks and saves a key, as profile `default` or the one given with `--profile` |
| `zeldoc auth list` | Lists the saved profiles, marking the default and the one pinned for this folder |
| `zeldoc auth use <profile>` | Makes a saved profile the default |
| `zeldoc auth pin <profile>` | Pins the current folder to a profile (writes `.zeldoc-profile`) |
| `zeldoc auth status` | Shows which key is in use (masked), why, and whether it works; exits 1 if not |
| `zeldoc auth fields` | Shows the key fields your organization set on the key, such as its team or project |
| `zeldoc auth token` | Prints the key, for tools that read `ZELDOC_API_KEY` |
| `zeldoc auth logout` | Deletes the saved key of the profile in use |

### One key per customer

If you work for several customers, each with their own Zeldoc.ai key, save each key under
a profile name and pin each customer's repository to its profile:

```bash
zeldoc auth login --profile acme      # save Acme's key
zeldoc auth login --profile globex    # save Globex's key

cd ~/work/acme-app
zeldoc auth pin acme                  # writes .zeldoc-profile containing "acme"
zeldoc usage                          # uses Acme's key here and in every folder below
```

`.zeldoc-profile` holds only the profile name, never a key, so you can commit it. Everyone
on the team then saves their own key under that name by running `zeldoc auth login` in
the repository; with a pin and no `--profile`, `login` saves under the pinned name.

The CLI picks the key in this order:

1. `--profile <name>` (or `-P`), or the `ZELDOC_PROFILE` variable
2. `.zeldoc-profile` in the current folder or the nearest folder above it
3. `ZELDOC_API_KEY`
4. the default profile: the first key you saved, or the one set with `zeldoc auth use`

A pin wins over `ZELDOC_API_KEY`, so it still applies when your shell profile exports the
variable. If a pin names a profile that is not saved, the CLI stops with an error instead
of using another customer's key. On a machine with no saved keys, such as CI, pins are
ignored and `ZELDOC_API_KEY` is used. `zeldoc auth status` shows which key is used and
why.

To hand the pinned key to other tools started in the repository, such as OpenCode or an
OpenAI SDK, use [direnv](https://direnv.net) (Linux and macOS) with this `.envrc`:

```bash
export ZELDOC_API_KEY="$(zeldoc auth token)"
```

`zeldoc usage --all` reports the usage of every saved profile, one row each, with a total.

### Where the key is stored

All saved keys are in `credentials.json` in the platform config directory:

| Platform | Path |
|---|---|
| Linux | `~/.config/zeldoc/credentials.json` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/zeldoc/credentials.json` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\zeldoc\credentials.json` |

`ZELDOC_CONFIG_DIR` overrides the directory. On Unix the file is created with mode `0600`
in a `0700` directory, so only your user can read it. It is not encrypted: like
`~/.codex/auth.json` or `~/.aws/credentials`, anything running as your user, including an
AI agent with shell access, can read it. The same is true of `ZELDOC_API_KEY` in your
environment.

### Using the saved key in other tools

`zeldoc auth token` prints the key the CLI uses: `ZELDOC_API_KEY` if it is set, otherwise
the key saved by `zeldoc auth login`. It does not create a new key and makes no network
call, so it is cheap to run every time a shell starts.

A program cannot set environment variables in the shell that started it, so
`zeldoc auth login` cannot set `ZELDOC_API_KEY` for you. Set it from `zeldoc auth token`
in your shell profile instead, so every new shell has it. To set it in the current shell
only, run the same line there.

**Linux and macOS (bash, zsh).** Add this line to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` (zsh is the
default shell on macOS):

```bash
export ZELDOC_API_KEY="$(zeldoc auth token)"
```

**fish.** Add this line to `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:

```fish
set -gx ZELDOC_API_KEY (zeldoc auth token)
```

**Windows (PowerShell).** Add the line to your PowerShell profile, creating the profile
first if you don't have one:

```powershell
if (-not (Test-Path $PROFILE)) { New-Item -ItemType File -Path $PROFILE -Force | Out-Null }
Add-Content -Path $PROFILE -Value '$env:ZELDOC_API_KEY = zeldoc auth token'
```

If new PowerShell windows then report that running scripts is disabled, the execution
policy is blocking your profile. `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned`
allows local scripts such as the profile to run.

**Programs started from the Start menu or the Dock** don't read shell profiles. On Windows,
set a user environment variable instead:

```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("ZELDOC_API_KEY", (zeldoc auth token), "User")
```

This stores a copy of the key in your Windows user environment. Run it again after you
change key, then restart the programs that use it.

Setting the variable from `zeldoc auth token` keeps the key out of your profile file,
which often ends up in a dotfiles repository. The key is still in the environment of every
program started from that shell, as with a hand-written `export`.

After `zeldoc auth login` with a new key, open a new shell: shells that are already open
keep the old value, and `ZELDOC_API_KEY` takes precedence over the saved key.

## Show a key's fields

```bash
zeldoc auth fields
zeldoc auth fields --all
zeldoc auth fields --json
```

Organizations can label their API keys with fields, such as a team, a project or whether
the key is private; their admins set them in the dashboard. `zeldoc auth fields` shows the
key's name and each of the organization's fields with this key's value, from Zeldoc.ai's
key endpoint (`GET /v1/zeldoc/key`). Only the key the CLI uses is shown; `--all` shows the
key of every saved profile. `--json` prints each value as the API sends it: a select
field's option key, with its label in `value_label`.

## List models

```bash
zeldoc models
zeldoc models --mode chat
zeldoc models --json
```

Lists the models your key can use from Zeldoc.ai's model catalog
(`GET /v1/zeldoc/models`): kind, context window, output limit, your organization's price
per 1 million tokens, and capabilities. `--json` adds cache prices and the accepted
`reasoning_effort` values. `--mode` filters on the kind: `chat`, `responses`,
`embedding`, `image_generation`, `audio_transcription` or `realtime`.

The gateway's own `GET /v1/models` only lists names; it has no limits or prices for
aliases such as `zdev`, which is why the CLI uses the catalog.

## Show usage

```bash
zeldoc usage
zeldoc usage --period today
zeldoc usage --period last-month --json
```

Shows what your API key has used from Zeldoc.ai's usage endpoint
(`GET /v1/zeldoc/usage`): requests, input, output and cached tokens, and cost per model,
with a total. Costs are in USD, as the dashboard shows them; Zeldoc.ai's own models are
covered by the subscription and cost 0. `--period` is `today`, `week`
(the last 7 days), `month` (this calendar month, the default) or `last-month`, all in UTC.
`--profile` picks another saved key, and `--all` reports every saved profile instead.
When the key has a monthly spend limit, the report shows how much of it is used, and for
organizations on prepaid credits, the credits left. For a key that belongs to a ZDev seat,
it shows how much of the plan's monthly tokens are used. `--json` prints exact costs and cache
writes.

Only the key the CLI uses is reported, never other keys of your organization; the
dashboard at [app.zeldoc.ai](https://app.zeldoc.ai) shows the whole organization. New
requests can take a minute to appear.

## Search the web

```bash
zeldoc search podman rootless ports below 1024
zeldoc search --engines github,stackoverflow -n 5 axum middleware
zeldoc search --json --time-range week rust 2024 edition
```

Calls Zeldoc.ai's search endpoint (`POST /v1/search/zeldoc-search`). General searches use
Staan, an EU-based provider; `--categories it` and `--engines` can reach services outside
the EU. See [Web search](https://docs.zeldoc.ai/web-search) for what leaves your machine,
and keep personal or confidential information out of queries.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ZELDOC_PROFILE` | | Saved profile to use, like `--profile` |
| `ZELDOC_API_KEY` | | API key; used where no profile is picked by `--profile`, `ZELDOC_PROFILE` or a pin |
| `ZELDOC_CONFIG_DIR` | platform config directory + `/zeldoc` | Where the saved key lives |
| `ZELDOC_NO_UPDATE_CHECK` | | Any value turns off the daily check for a newer release |
